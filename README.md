# Deep Learning Repository

## Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive workspace for my **Deep Learning journey**, encompassing theoretical foundations, hands-on implementations, and end-to-end projects with real-world relevance. The primary objective of this repository is to build a **strong conceptual understanding** while simultaneously developing **production-grade deep learning models**.

The work here reflects a disciplined approach to learning, experimentation, and reproducibility — essential traits for research and industry-level machine learning.

---

## Objectives
- Develop a solid foundation in **Deep Learning concepts and architectures**
- Implement models using industry-standard libraries
- Apply deep learning techniques to **real-world datasets**
- Maintain clean, modular, and reproducible code
- Build projects aligned with **industry and research expectations**

---

## Repository Structure



---

## Key Topics Covered
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- Loss functions and optimisation techniques
- Gradient Descent and Backpropagation
- Feature scaling and data preprocessing
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Overfitting, regularisation, and generalisation
- Practical implementation using structured datasets

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **NumPy & Pandas** for data handling
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualisation
- **Scikit-learn** for preprocessing and evaluation
- **TensorFlow / Keras** for deep learning models
- **Google Colab & Jupyter Notebook** for experimentation

---

## Methodology
Each project follows a structured pipeline:
1. Data understanding and preprocessing  
2. Feature engineering and scaling  
3. Model design and training  
4. Evaluation and validation  
5. Interpretation of results  

This ensures clarity, reproducibility, and scalability.

## Learning Philosophy
Rather than treating deep learning as a black box, this repository emphasises:
- **Mathematical intuition**
- **Clear reasoning behind architectural choices**
- **Critical evaluation of results**

The goal is not merely to build models, but to **understand why they work**.

---

## Future Scope
- Advanced neural architectures
- Hyperparameter optimisation
- Model interpretability
- Domain-specific applications (e.g., finance, risk modelling)
- Deployment-ready workflows

## Author
**Harsh Sharma**  
Research-driven learner with a strong interest in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and their applications in complex problem-solving domains.

## Disclaimer
This repository is actively evolving. Code, structure, and documentation may be refined as learning progresses and complexity increases.
